          <blockquote>"There's a lot of hoo-hah about the "perceptual-motor grounding" of
          language. We looked at the processing of metaphors like "grasp an
          idea" and found a very interesting and satisfying pattern of results.
          Such metaphors do activate corresponding sensory/motor brain systems
          but only if they are relatively unfamiliar. More familiar metaphoric
          expressions and abstract expressions ("understand the idea") do not.
          People's comprehension is not limited to what can be physically
          embodied, folks."</blockquote>
