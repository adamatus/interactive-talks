=================

This framework allows for the creation of interactive slide decks to be shown
using a modern web browser. By interactive, I mean fully interactive. Harnessing
the power of [d3.js](http://d3js.org) we can draw figures directly from data, animate them, and
make them respond in interesting ways to mouse interaction.

Like to get your hands dirty writing code? This framework is for you. Everything
is pure HTML and javascript, with only a simple structure to power everything.
With that simplicity come incredible flexibility and power. Anything you can do
on the web can be embedded directly into your talk.

The framework was inspired by Mike Bostock's early highlight reel talks showing
off the power of d3. I've considerably tweaked the framework to work with my
presentation style and added some additional navigation functions.
